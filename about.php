        Hello!  I took an interest in tracking data regarding the coronavirus pandemic in early April when I realised that there was no political will to 
        calculate a local R and tracking/validating local Wigan information released by Gov.UK, NHS England, NHS Digital, and ONS.  
        At first, I was tracking in an Excel spreadsheet, but got fed up with that and decided to build a website to support this work.
    <p>

    <p>
        Some of our family members are on the clinically vulnerable list and I felt that easement on lockdown was too soon.  Therefore, I was 
        extremely interested in tracking and maintaining my own data to use for decision making and for use as evidence that supports my decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a full stack web developer who is looking for work.  I also have extensive experience as a Business Analyst.  If you are interested 
        in knowing more about me, please contact me and I will refer you through to the recruiter that I am working with.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the meantime, maintain physical distancing, wash your hands, wear a face cover in public enclosed areas, look after your neighbours and STAY SAFE!
